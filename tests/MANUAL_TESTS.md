# user story tests
- I want the software to load at the center of my screen.
Both the initial menus and the main game window should open at the center of the screen.

*I want to be able to change the settings before starting the game.*  
In the menu, open the settings page and find all the available settings and options.

*I want to have an interactive menu capable of properly leading the user to the game.*  
When you first run the game, make sure that the menu is properly loading.
